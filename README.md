# FileServer

It is possible to download files, find and delete them with FileServer.
Sharing feature was not implemented.

You need to run 'mvn clean package' to build the project. zips TestClient-1.0-SNAPSHOT-tool and TestServer-1.0-SNAPSHOT-tool will be appeared in target folders. In every zip you can find a .bat file. Config specific params in them and run.
